# DriftBoard

A personal Kanban board application built with TypeScript, React, and Node.js. This project serves as both a replacement for Trello's paid features and a comprehensive learning platform for modern web development technologies.

## 🚀 Project Overview

DriftBoard is a self-hosted personal project management tool that provides:
- Visual kanban-style boards for organizing projects
- Drag-and-drop functionality for task management
- Personal workflow optimization without subscription costs
- Modern tech stack implementation as a learning experience

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript and Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js API with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with type-safe queries
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with JWT tokens
- **Deployment**: Docker containerized for consistent development and deployment

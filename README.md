- 🔄 **Search** - Find cards and boards quickly
- 🔄 **Firebase Auth** - Proper user authentication

## 🏗️ Architecture

This application utilizes a multi-container architecture orchestrated by Docker Compose to create a robust and scalable development environment that mirrors a production setup. This approach separates the frontend, backend, and other services into distinct containers.

The key services are:
-   **Nginx:** Serves the static React frontend application and acts as a reverse proxy, directing API requests to the backend service.
-   **Backend:** A Node.js/Express container that runs the application's REST API and communicates with the database.
-   **Backup:** A utility container responsible for performing periodic backups of the database.

For a complete overview and detailed diagrams of the system, please refer to the [**Architecture Documentation](./docs/architecture/01-system-overview.md)**.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Redux Toolkit + RTK Query
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Prisma ORM
- **Database**: SQLite with WAL mode
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI components
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (planned) / Mock auth (current)
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose

## 🚀 Quick Start

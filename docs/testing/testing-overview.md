## Executive Summary

DriftBoard has a comprehensive, multi-layered testing strategy covering **Component**, **Integration**, **End-to-End (E2E)**, and **Manual** testing. This ensures reliability and correctness across the full-stack application, with high coverage of critical user paths, API endpoints, and UI components.

**Total Test Coverage:**
- **40+ automated test cases** across 11 test files
- **4 testing layers** (Component, Integration, E2E, Manual)
- **100% API endpoint coverage** for core features (including move operations)
- **100% critical user journey coverage** (including drag-and-drop)

## Current Testing Architecture

### 1. Component Tests (React Testing Library)
**Framework:** Vitest + React Testing Library
**Location:** `src/frontend/src/components/`
**Purpose:** Isolate and verify individual React components.

#### Coverage:
- âœ… **KanbanCard**: Rendering, user interactions, and props handling.
- âœ… **List**: Rendering, props, and container logic.

#### Test Files:
```
src/frontend/src/components/kanban/KanbanCard.test.tsx
src/frontend/src/components/kanban/List.test.tsx
```

### 2. Unit Tests (Vitest)
**Framework:** Vitest
**Location:** `tests/unit/`
**Purpose:** Validate isolated business logic and utility functions.

#### Coverage:
- âœ… **Position Calculation**: Correctly calculates new position for drag-and-drop items.

#### Test Files:
```
tests/unit/position.test.ts
```

### 3. Integration Tests (Vitest)
**Framework:** Vitest  
**Location:** `tests/integration/`  
**Purpose:** API endpoint validation and data integrity.

#### Coverage:
- âœ… **Health endpoint** - Server status and metadata.
- âœ… **Boards API** - Listing and detail views.
- âœ… **Cards API** - Move operations.
- âœ… **Lists API** - Move operations.
- âœ… **Data structure validation** - Response format and field presence.
- âœ… **HTTP status codes** - Proper response codes for all scenarios.

#### Test Files:
```
tests/integration/api.test.ts
tests/integration/cards.test.ts
tests/integration/lists.test.ts
```

#### Scripts:
```bash
npm run test:integration  # Run integration tests
npm run test:watch       # Watch mode for development
```

### 4. End-to-End Tests (Playwright)
**Framework:** Playwright  
**Location:** `tests/e2e/`  
**Purpose:** Complete user journey validation and browser testing.

#### Coverage:

- âœ… **Drag and Drop**:
  - Reordering cards within a list.
  - Moving cards between lists.
  - Reordering lists on the board.

#### Test Files:
```
tests/e2e/app.spec.ts
tests/e2e/api.spec.ts
tests/e2e/basic.spec.ts
tests/e2e/dnd.spec.ts  # New
tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts
```

#### Scripts:
```bash
npm run test:e2e         # Run API + UI tests
npm run test:e2e:ui      # Interactive Playwright UI
npm run test:e2e:headed  # Run with visible browser
```

**Coverage:** **100% of critical user journeys** (including Phase 2 D&D)

- âœ… **Error scenarios** - Network failures and invalid data
- âœ… **Performance** - Load times and responsiveness

#### Browser Testing:
- âœ… **Chrome** (Primary development browser)
- âœ… **Firefox** (Playwright automated testing)
- âœ… **Safari** (Playwright automated testing)

**Coverage:** **100% of implemented features** manually validated

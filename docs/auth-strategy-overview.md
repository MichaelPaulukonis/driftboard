# Framework-Agnostic User Authentication Strategy

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for implementing user authentication in a modern web application. It covers the core features from user registration to session management and is designed to be a reusable template.

### 1. Core Principles

*   **Secure by Default**: All sensitive operations are handled by a dedicated, trusted authentication provider (e.g., Firebase Auth, Auth0, Supabase Auth). The backend never directly handles passwords.
*   **Stateless Backend**: The API is stateless, relying on JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authenticating every request.
*   **Seamless User Experience**: The flow for sign-up, login, and social login is designed to be as frictionless as possible.

### 2. Feature Implementation

#### A. User Registration (Email & Password)

*   **Flow**:
    1.  User navigates to a dedicated `/signup` page.
    2.  User fills out a form with their email, a strong password, and a password confirmation.
    3.  The client-side application sends these credentials directly to the authentication provider.
    4.  The provider creates the user account and returns a JWT to the client.
    5.  The client stores the JWT securely and redirects the user to the main application.
*   **Live Validation**:
    *   **Password Strength**: As the user types in the password field, real-time feedback is provided on its strength (e.g., length, character types). The sign-up button remains disabled until the password meets the minimum requirements.
    *   **Password Confirmation**: As the user types in the "confirm password" field, a real-time check is performed to ensure it matches the first password. An error message is displayed if they do not match.

#### B. User Login

*   **Email & Password**:
    1.  User enters their credentials on the `/login` page.
    2.  The client sends the credentials to the authentication provider.
    3.  The provider validates the credentials and returns a JWT.
    4.  The client stores the JWT and redirects the user.
*   **Social Login (e.g., "Sign in with Google")**:
    1.  User clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.
    2.  The client application triggers a popup or redirect flow managed by the authentication provider's SDK.
    3.  The user authenticates with the social provider (e.g., Google).
    4.  On success, the provider returns a JWT to the client application.
    5.  The client stores the JWT and redirects the user.

#### C. Session Management

*   **JWT Storage**: The JWT received upon login/sign-up is stored in a secure, persistent location on the client (e.g., `localStorage` or a secure cookie).
*   **Token Refresh**: The authentication provider's client-side SDK is responsible for automatically refreshing the JWT before it expires, ensuring a persistent session for the user.
*   **Logout**:
    1.  User clicks a "Logout" button.
    2.  The client application instructs the authentication provider's SDK to invalidate the current session.
    3.  The client removes the stored JWT.
    4.  The client clears any user-related state from memory (e.g., Redux store, API cache).
    5.  The user is redirected to the login page.

#### D. Protected Resources

*   **Frontend**:
    *   A "Protected Route" mechanism wraps all pages/routes that require authentication.
    *   This mechanism checks for the presence and validity of a user session in the application's state.
    *   If the user is not authenticated, they are automatically redirected to the `/login` page.
*   **Backend**:
    *   An authentication middleware is applied to all protected API endpoints.
    *   On every incoming request, the middleware inspects the `Authorization` header for a `Bearer <JWT>`.
    *   It validates the JWT with the authentication provider.
    *   If the token is valid, the request proceeds. If not, a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` error is returned.

#### E. User Profile

*   A view-only `/profile` page is available to authenticated users.
*   This page displays non-sensitive user information (e.g., display name, email address) retrieved from the application's state, which was populated from the JWT upon login.

This strategy provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly authentication system that can be adapted to various projects and technology stacks.

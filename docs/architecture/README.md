# Architecture Documentation Index

This directory contains comprehensive architecture documentation for DriftBoard, a personal kanban board application. The documentation is organized into logical sections covering all aspects of system design and implementation.

## Document Structure

### [01. System Overview](./01-system-overview.md)
High-level architecture overview including:
- System architecture diagram and component relationships
- Technology stack justification and selection criteria  
- Core architectural patterns and principles
- Data flow architecture and security considerations
- Development environment overview

### [02. System Components](./02-system-components.md)
Detailed component architecture covering:
- Frontend architecture with React, Redux, and component hierarchy
- Backend API structure with Express, services, and repositories
- Database design with Prisma schema and relationships
- External service integrations (Firebase Auth)
- Caching strategies and state management patterns

### [03. Scalability & Performance](./03-scalability-performance.md)
Performance optimization and scaling strategies:
- Current performance optimizations for frontend and backend
- Scalability pathways from single-user to enterprise scale
- Performance bottlenecks identification and solutions
- Multi-layer caching architecture
- Load balancing considerations for future growth

### [04. Security Architecture](./04-security-architecture.md)
Comprehensive security design:
- Firebase Authentication integration and token management
- Authorization patterns and resource-based access control
- Data protection, encryption, and transport security
- API security with input validation, rate limiting, and CORS
- Common vulnerability mitigations (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)
- Security monitoring and logging strategies

### [05. Development & Deployment](./05-development-deployment.md)
Development workflow and deployment strategies:
- Development environment setup and configuration
- Docker containerization for development and production
- CI/CD pipeline architecture with GitHub Actions
- Local and production deployment strategies
- Monitoring, logging, and health check implementations

### [06. Alternative Approaches](./06-alternative-approaches.md)
Analysis of different architectural options:
- **Approach 1**: Monolithic full-stack (Recommended for MVP)
- **Approach 2**: Microservices with container orchestration
- **Approach 3**: Hybrid multi-container architecture
- Detailed pros/cons analysis and decision matrix
- Migration paths between approaches

### [07. Implementation Phases](./07-implementation-phases.md)
Phased development plan:
- **Phase 1**: MVP Foundation (Week 1-2) - Core kanban functionality
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced Functionality (Week 3-4) - Rich editing and search
- **Phase 3**: Production Polish (Week 5-6) - Testing and optimization
- **Phase 4**: Future Enhancements (Month 2+) - Multi-user and extensions
- Dependencies, critical path analysis, and success metrics

## Quick Reference

### Technology Stack Summary
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Redux Toolkit + ShadCN/UI
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Prisma ORM
- **Database**: SQLite (MVP) â†’ PostgreSQL (Multi-user)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with docker-compose
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Container-first deployment** for consistency and scalability
2. **API-first design** with clear frontend/backend separation
3. **Type safety** with full TypeScript implementation across stack
4. **Authentication-as-a-Service** using Firebase for zero-maintenance auth
5. **Monolithic MVP** transitioning to multi-container for scale

### Development Priorities
1. **Simplicity over complexity** - Start simple, add complexity when needed
2. **Learning focus** - Emphasize React/TypeScript/Firebase learning
3. **Cost optimization** - Zero budget constraint with local deployment
4. **Extensibility** - Clean architecture enabling future enhancements

## Next Steps

1. **Review the full architecture**: Start with [System Overview](./01-system-overview.md)
2. **Understand the recommended approach**: See [Alternative Approaches](./06-alternative-approaches.md)
3. **Plan implementation**: Follow [Implementation Phases](./07-implementation-phases.md)
4. **Set up development environment**: Use [Development & Deployment](./05-development-deployment.md)

## Architecture Principles

### Core Values
- **Developer Experience**: Fast feedback loops, good tooling, clear documentation
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage for fewer runtime errors
- **Testability**: Components and APIs designed for easy testing
- **Performance**: Optimized for smooth user experience even with large datasets
- **Security**: Production-ready security practices from day one

### Design Patterns
- **Container/Presentation Pattern**: Separation of data logic and UI rendering
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer abstraction
- **API-First**: Backend designed as a service, frontend as a client
- **Event-Driven**: Redux actions and effects for predictable state changes

### Future Considerations
- **Multi-user support**: Database schema and authentication ready for expansion
- **Real-time collaboration**: WebSocket foundation planned for Phase 4
- **Mobile responsive**: UI designed mobile-first with responsive breakpoints
- **Offline capability**: Service worker and local storage strategies
- **Chrome extension**: Architecture supports browser extension integration

This documentation serves as both a reference during development and a guide for future enhancements and scaling decisions.

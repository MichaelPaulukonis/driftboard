# E2E Testing Setup - DriftBoard

## Overview

Playwright e2e tests have been configured for DriftBoard to test the complete application flow including API endpoints and user interface interactions.

## Files Created

### Configuration
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration with API and browser testing setup
- `tests/e2e/` - E2E test directory structure

### Test Files
- `tests/e2e/basic.spec.ts` - Core functionality tests (API + UI)
- `tests/e2e/api.spec.ts` - API endpoint integration tests  
- `tests/e2e/app.spec.ts` - Full application workflow tests
- `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts` - Basic smoke tests

## Test Coverage

### API Tests ✅
- Health endpoint validation
- Boards listing API
- Individual board details API
- Data structure validation
- Response format verification

### UI Tests ✅
- Homepage loads correctly
- Header and navigation elements
- Board listing page functionality
- Board detail navigation flow
- List and card display verification
- Back navigation functionality

### Navigation Flow Tests ✅
- Boards list → Board detail
- Board detail → Back to boards list
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive layout with horizontal scrolling

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run with browser visible (headed mode)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/basic.spec.ts
```

## Configuration Details

### Browsers Configured
- Chromium (primary)
- Firefox (available)
- Safari/WebKit (available)

### Test Environment
- Frontend: http://localhost:3002
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- Timeout: 30 seconds per test
- Retry: 2 attempts on CI

### Prerequisites
Both servers must be running:
```bash
npm run dev:backend   # Port 8000
npm run dev:frontend  # Port 3002
```

## Test Structure

Each test follows this pattern:
1. **Setup** - Navigate to page/endpoint
2. **Action** - Perform user interaction or API call
3. **Assert** - Verify expected behavior
4. **Cleanup** - Automatic (handled by Playwright)

## Phase 1 MVP Coverage ✅

The e2e tests cover all Phase 1 requirements:
- ✅ Board listing functionality
- ✅ Board detail navigation  
- ✅ List and card display
- ✅ API integration end-to-end
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Responsive UI behavior

## Next Steps

For Phase 2, additional tests should cover:
- Board/list/card CRUD operations
- Drag and drop functionality  
- Form submissions and validation
- Authentication flows
- Error scenarios and edge cases

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail to run:
1. Ensure both servers are running
2. Install Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install`
3. Check port availability (3002 frontend, 8000 backend)
4. Verify database is seeded with test data

## Browser Installation

If browser tests don't work:
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

**Status**: ✅ E2E infrastructure complete for Phase 1 MVP  
**Next**: Ready for Phase 2 feature development with test coverage

# I'm working on my keybinding settings here in VS C (2025-07-11 16:50Z)

I'm working on my keybinding settings here in VS Code. `keybindings (1).json` is a reference from another instance; `keybindings.json` is live in my User settings. What I don't have is a "new terminal" action that I had in other environments and have forgotten how to implement. When "editorFocus" "cmd+n" open a new editor tab. When "terminalFocus" I want "cmd+n" to open a new terminal.

What i the "command" for this?

Of course. The command you're looking for is `workbench.action.terminal.new`.

To implement the behavior you've described, you can add the following to your `keybindings.json` file. The `when` clause ensures this keybinding is only active when the terminal has focus, so it won't interfere with the default "new file" action when you're in the editor.

I will now add this keybinding to your `keybindings.json` file.

Of course. The command you're looking for is `workbench.action.terminal.new`.

I have added the following to your `keybindings.json` file to implement the behavior you described. This configuration will trigger `workbench.action.terminal.new` when you press `cmd+n` while the terminal is focused. The default behavior for `cmd+n` (opening a new file) will remain active when the editor is focused.

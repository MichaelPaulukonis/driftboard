# I have created a temp file, `temp.md` in the root  (2025-07-10 12:55Z)

_**User**_

I have created a temp file, `temp.md` in the root of this project. Please use the filesystem mcp tool to delete the file. If you are unable to use the tool for any reason, please report any issues and stop. Do not delete the file except by using the filesystem mcp tool.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll use the filesystem MCP tool to delete the `temp.md` file from the root of your project. I encountered an issue using the MCP filesystem tool. The error indicates that the path is outside the allowed directories. Let me check what directories are allowed by the MCP filesystem tool. The issue is that the MCP filesystem tool can only access files within the `/app` directory, but your project is located at ``. The MCP filesystem tool has restricted access and cannot delete files outside of its allowed directory (`/app`).

**Issue Report:** 
- The MCP filesystem tool has access restrictions that prevent it from operating on files in your project directory
- The tool can only access `/app` directory, but your project is at ``
- This is a permission/security limitation of the MCP filesystem tool configuration

I cannot delete the `temp.md` file using the MCP filesystem tool due to these access restrictions.

Hrm. The filesystem config _used_ to work and has not been modified. It's possible something changed in Docker or in the config or VS Code that I'm not aware of. The mcp-server config has been highlighted. I'm not familiar with all of the Docker args there, especially "--workdir". I would have expected that "/app/projects" would have worked for "/Users/michaelpualukonis/projects/driftboard", though. Can you see anything wrong with this setup? There are additional notes in the mcp-server's README @ https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-filesystem-server/blob/main/README.md

_**Assistant**_

I can see the issue with your MCP filesystem configuration. Let me fetch the README to understand the expected setup and then explain what's wrong. Now I understand the issue! Looking at the README and your configuration, there's a mismatch between how you're configuring the Docker setup and what the MCP filesystem server expects.

**The Problem:**

Your current configuration:
```jsonc
"args": [
  "run",
  "-i",
  "--rm",
  "--workdir=/app",
  "--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects:/app/projects",
  "--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/Documents:/app/Documents", 
  "--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/Downloads:/app/Downloads",
  "ghcr.io/mark3labs/mcp-filesystem-server:latest"
]
```

**Issue 1:** You're missing the allowed directory arguments that the MCP filesystem server requires.

**Issue 2:** The `--workdir=/app` is setting the working directory inside the container, but you need to pass the allowed directories as arguments to the mcp-filesystem-server executable.

According to the README, the correct Docker configuration should be:

```jsonc
"filesystem": {
  "command": "docker",
  "args": [
    "run",
    "-i", 
    "--rm",
    "--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects:/app/projects",
    "--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/Documents:/app/Documents",
    "--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/Downloads:/app/Downloads", 
    "ghcr.io/mark3labs/mcp-filesystem-server:latest",
    "/app/projects",
    "/app/Documents", 
    "/app/Downloads"
  ]
}
```

**Key changes needed:**

1. **Remove `--workdir=/app`** - This isn't needed and may be causing confusion
2. **Add the allowed directory paths as arguments** after the Docker image name - these should be the paths as they appear *inside* the container (e.g., `/app/projects`, `/app/Documents`, `/app/Downloads`)

The volume mounts map your host directories to container paths, and then you need to tell the mcp-filesystem-server which container paths it's allowed to access.

Try updating your settings.json with this corrected configuration, and then the path `/app/projects/driftboard/temp.md` should work for deleting the file.

_**User**_

Thanks! I've updated the settings and restarted the mcp server. Try to delete `temp.md` again, using only the filesystem mcp server.

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! Now that you've updated the settings and restarted the MCP server, let me try to delete the `temp.md` file using the filesystem MCP tool with the correct path. Excellent! The file has been successfully deleted using the MCP filesystem tool. The configuration fix worked perfectly - by adding the allowed directory arguments (`/app/projects`, `/app/Documents`, `/app/Downloads`) and using the correct container path `/app/projects/driftboard/temp.md`, the MCP filesystem server was able to access and delete the file as requested.

Can you write up a short explanation of this issue and the fix? I'm working on learning Docker more intensively, and would like to document this. Please put everything into a single markdown formatted code block.

# MCP Filesystem Server Docker Configuration Issue

## Problem
The MCP filesystem server was failing with "access denied - path outside allowed directories" errors when trying to access files in the project directory.

## Root Cause
The Docker configuration was missing the required allowed directory arguments that the MCP filesystem server executable needs to function properly.

## Original (Broken) Configuration
```jsonc
"filesystem": {
  "command": "docker",
  "args": [
    "run",
    "-i",
    "--rm",
    "--workdir=/app",
    "--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects:/app/projects",
    "--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/Documents:/app/Documents",
    "--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/Downloads:/app/Downloads",
    "ghcr.io/mark3labs/mcp-filesystem-server:latest"
  ]
}
```

## Fixed Configuration
```jsonc
"filesystem": {
  "command": "docker",
  "args": [
    "run",
    "-i",
    "--rm",
    "--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects:/app/projects",
    "--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/Documents:/app/Documents",
    "--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/Downloads:/app/Downloads",
    "ghcr.io/mark3labs/mcp-filesystem-server:latest",
    "/app/projects",
    "/app/Documents",
    "/app/Downloads"
  ]
}
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed `--workdir=/app`**: This Docker flag was unnecessary and potentially confusing the setup
2. **Added allowed directory arguments**: The arguments `/app/projects`, `/app/Documents`, `/app/Downloads` are passed to the mcp-filesystem-server executable inside the container

## Docker Concepts Explained

### Volume Mounting
- `--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects:/app/projects` maps the host directory to a container directory
- Host path (left): `` 
- Container path (right): `/app/projects`

### Command Arguments vs Docker Flags
- Docker flags (like `--volume`, `--rm`) configure the container
- Arguments after the image name (`ghcr.io/mark3labs/mcp-filesystem-server:latest`) are passed to the executable inside the container
- The mcp-filesystem-server executable requires allowed directory paths as arguments for security

### Security Model
The MCP filesystem server implements a whitelist security model:
- Only directories explicitly listed as arguments are accessible
- This prevents directory traversal attacks
- Paths must be specified as they appear inside the container (`/app/projects`, not ``)

## Usage After Fix
Files can now be accessed using container paths:
- Host file: `/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/driftboard/temp.md`
- Container path: `/app/projects/driftboard/temp.md`

_**User**_

Thanks! In what situations, if any, is the `--workdir=/foo` flag needed?

---

_**Assistant**_

The `--workdir=/foo` Docker flag sets the working directory inside the container where commands will be executed. Here are the main situations where it's useful:

## When `--workdir` is Needed

### 1. **Relative Path Operations**
When your application uses relative paths and needs to start from a specific directory:
```bash
# Without --workdir, app might look for ./config.json in /
# With --workdir=/app, app looks for ./config.json in /app
docker run --workdir=/app myapp ./start.sh
```

### 2. **Build Contexts and Multi-Stage Builds**
In Dockerfiles when you need to set a working directory:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
```

### 3. **Interactive Development**
When you want to drop into a container at a specific location:
```bash
# Opens shell in /app directory
docker run -it --workdir=/app --volume=$(pwd):/app ubuntu bash
```

### 4. **Legacy Applications**
Applications that expect to run from a specific directory:
```bash
# Some apps break if not run from their installation directory
docker run --workdir=/opt/myapp legacy-app
```

## When `--workdir` is NOT Needed

### 1. **Absolute Paths (like MCP filesystem server)**
When the executable uses absolute paths and doesn't rely on current directory:
```bash
# mcp-filesystem-server takes absolute paths as arguments
# Current directory doesn't matter
docker run mcp-filesystem-server /app/data /app/logs
```

### 2. **Well-Designed Container Images**
Images that already set appropriate WORKDIR in their Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Image already sets working directory
FROM nginx:alpine
# WORKDIR is already set to /usr/share/nginx/html
```

### 3. **Stateless Services**
Services that don't read local files or use relative paths.

## In Your MCP Case

The `--workdir=/app` was unnecessary because:
- The mcp-filesystem-server doesn't use relative paths
- It takes absolute directory paths as arguments (`/app/projects`)
- The current working directory doesn't affect its operation
- Removing it simplified the configuration without losing functionality

The key insight is that `--workdir` changes where commands execute inside the container, but it doesn't affect how volume mounts work or what paths the application can access.

Okay, I will add a `README.md` to the `` directory and update the documentation.

First, I'll create the `README.md` file in the `` directory. Okay, I've added the `README.md` to the `` directory. Now I'll add a mention of this folder to the project documentation. I'll check for the best place in the `` directory to add this information. `05-development-deployment.md` seems like a good candidate. I have added the `README.md` to the `` directory. Now I will update the project documentation to reflect the purpose of this folder. I've identified `05-development-deployment.md` as the correct place for this information.
